               technology community through professional
               development and learning opportunities. <br />Join us December 13th - 19th.</h5>
            <p>This year, we are setting out to spark curiosity in the tech community with the creation of Curiosity
               Week. From December 13th - 19th, there will be 30+ events revolving around technology. These
               events will be curated to engage those interested in pursuing tech as a career, provide professional
               development to technology professionals, and give tech entrepreneurs a place to convene. We
               believe that at the core, growth is sparked by curiosity - so letâ€™s start there.</p>
            <p>Thanks to the generosity of our sponsors, <strong>tickets are now FREE</strong> (previously $129).
               You will still need to register on Sched for the individual events that you are interested (see
               below).
            </p>
            <p>Events will be continually updated and added as we approach curiosity week so please check back often.
